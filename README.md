## Debugging
This project is set up to use [`react-native-debugger`](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which is integrated with both [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) and [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

To install the debugger for macOS:
`$ brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger`
